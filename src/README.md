# What is PyVision?

PyVision is a small package for basic frc utilities. It includes image editing, pre-coded models, OCR using pytesseract, and shape detection

# How to use PyVision
Git clone and import the sys module to append paths. 

# Dependencies

All modules must be imported before using the PyVision package. 

When using the pytesseract module, specify the tesseract.exe path before running code. To get the tesseract.exe path, enter tesseract_files and locate the application tesseract.exe. If you do not have a tesseract executable in the current path, use the setPath function from the OCR folder.
